\noindent Standard \LaTeX{} practice is to write inline math by enclosing it between \verb|\(...\)|:

\begin{quote}
In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated 
by the equation \(E=mc^2\), discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.
\end{quote}

\noindent Instead if writing (enclosing) inline math between \verb|\(...\)| you can use \texttt{\$...\$} to achieve the same result:

\begin{quote}
In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated 
by the equation $E=mc^2$, discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.
\end{quote}

\noindent Or, you can use \verb|\begin{math}...\end{math}|:

\begin{quote}
In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated 
by the equation \begin{math}E=mc^2\end{math}, discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.
\end{quote}
